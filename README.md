# @grantcodes/commit

A personal Commitizen config to help me create lovely, consistent, organized commits.

## Usage

1. Install with `npm install @grantcodes/commit --save-dev`
2. Run `npx @grantcodes/commit` to setup the automatic git hooks
3. Stage changes as usual
4. Run `git commit` when creating a commit and a nice UI should appear to help format commits
